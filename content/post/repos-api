Repos-api is a module that allow us to manage lua libraries on
our lide distribution.

LIDE_PATH environment variable stores the path of lide 
installation and is used with repos-api, so this var must exist.

We can perform operations with basic functions as:

- install_package (package_name, version)
- remove_package (package_name, bDepends)
- update_package (package_name, toVersion)
- list_packages (package_query) -- base64 2.6


Repos API depends on lide.http to download and interact with 
http servers.
